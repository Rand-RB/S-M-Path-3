#Writing Publisher And Subscriber Nodes In 3 Steps (Python)

#After creating catkin-package and install all package dependencies 
#(you can install them by following these steps http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage)
#“In this work space we will run (Hello World) node”

#1- Create a folder to store your python scripts

#- change the directory into your package by $roscd command
$ roscd beginner_tutorials
#create a folder called scripts
$ mkdir scripts
#change directory into this folder 
$ cd scripts 

#2-Write your node code

#For publisher(talker) node: 
#you can install this code from gitthub by the below command or write your own 
$ wget https://raw.github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/kinetic-devel/rospy_tutorials/001_talker_listener/talker.py
#change the access permission
$ chmod +x talker.py
#Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt. file then save the file
catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS scripts/talker.py
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)

#For subscriber node:
$ roscd beginner_tutorials/scripts/
#you can install this code from gitthub by the below command or write your own                                                                                              
$ wget https://raw.github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/kinetic-devel/rospy_tutorials/001_talker_listener/listener.py
#change the access permission                                                                                                                                                                                
$ chmod +x listener.py
#Add the following to your CMakeLists.txt. file then save the file
catkin_install_python(PROGRAMS scripts/talker.py scripts/listener.py
  DESTINATION ${CATKIN_PACKAGE_BIN_DESTINATION}
)

#3-Run your node and examine your result 
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
#open new terminal
$ roscore
#make sure you have sourced your workspace's setup.sh file after calling catkin_make but before trying to use your applications
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source ./devel/setup.bash
#run publisher node 
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials talker.py
#open new terminal and run subscriber node “run both nodes at the same time”
$ rosrun beginner_tutorials listener.py

#congrats!! you did a great job
